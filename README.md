# Biomedical-Image-Processing-using-FPGA
In the medical field diagnosis of diseases as soon as possible is a must. But, due to the complex nature of the Biomedical images obtained from several tests such as MRI scans, CT scans, and X-rays, several diseases remained undiagnosed. This paper illustrates the use of hardware named Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), to enhance the quality of such medical images with less effort. The project, medical image processing, is FPGA based designed for various bio-medical applications. Firstly, the medical image is collected from X-Ray, CT-Scan, or MRI scans. Then pre-processing of the image file is done in MATLAB i.e., converting the image type to a hexadecimal file. The obtained hexadecimal file is sent to the Basys 3 FPGA processor. The Verilog code for modeling the system is written using the image processing operators or filters such as Contrast filter, Brightness filter, Inverting filter, and Pseudo-color filter in Vivado Design Suite. Finally, the code is simulated in testbench, the output is generated, and the processed image is displayed on a monitor or sent to the web server.
